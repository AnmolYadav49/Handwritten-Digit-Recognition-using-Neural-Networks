✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks

This project implements a feed-forward neural network to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on normalized grayscale images and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to draw digits and receive real-time predictions.

The application demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. A custom drawing canvas enables intuitive user input, while the trained neural network predicts the digit along with a confidence score.

Key highlights:

Trained on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset

Feed-forward neural network built using TensorFlow/Keras

Image normalization, flattening, and one-hot encoding

Interactive Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions

Clean, modular, and beginner-friendly ML pipeline

Tech Stack:
**Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Streamlit**

**This project serves as a practical demonstration of neural networks and ML model deployment, suitable for academic use, portfolio showcasing, and introductory deep learning applications.**

**NOTE**:- In coming future i shall work throughly to train the Neural Network in such a way that it can identify how '7' can be differentiated with '3'. As well as increase the limit range of the Numbers from just 0-9 to 0-30.
